# IPL_Sponsors_Economic_Social_Impact_Analysis

Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 15

📌 Project Overview
This project was built as part of Codebasics Resume Challenge 15 where I analyzed the dual-sided impact of IPL 2025 sponsorships — the massive financial footprint vs the potential social & ethical concerns.

I played the role of Peter Pandey, a business journalist at Business Basics, assigned to explore:

Who sponsors IPL 2025?

How much do they contribute economically?

What are the possible health & social risks linked to certain sponsors?

Which demographic groups are most targeted?

What can be done to ensure responsible growth?

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI (Data Modeling, Relationships, DAX, Bookmarks, Visualizations)

Excel (Data Preparation & Cleaning)

Python (for minor dataset restructuring)

Web Research (Perplexity AI, Company Reports, Industry CAGR sources)

GitHub (Version Control)

🏟 Problem Statement
The IPL continues to attract significant ad spending, but more than 50% of IPL 2025 advertisements are taken by:

Fantasy Gaming Platforms (Dream11, My11Circle, PokerBaazi)

Pan Masala Brands (Vimal, Kamla Pasand, Rajshree)

Our goal was to evaluate both:

📈 The economic benefits IPL brings as an industry

⚠ The social & health risks due to certain brand categories

📊 Key Insights
Total disclosed sponsorship revenue (2025): ₹10,325 Cr

JioCinema and Star Sports account for ~90% of total disclosed sponsorships

6 brands identified as high-risk (gambling & surrogate pan masala advertising)

Primary audience is concentrated in Tier 2/3 urban youth and lower-middle income groups

Only Dream11 and PokerBaazi had enough financial data to estimate CAGR

Dream11 CAGR: ~10.7%

PokerBaazi CAGR: ~16.9%
